# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
software engineering is a discipline that involves the applcation of engineering principles to the design,development,testing, and maintanance of software systems, it differ from traditional programming in systemastic approach,emphasis on quality,scalability and maintainability as well as documentation and planning
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1. Initiation:

- Define project goals and objectives.

- Conduct feasibility studies.

- Identify stakeholders.

- Develop project charter.

2. Planning:

- Develop project management plan.

- Define scope, schedule, and budget.

- Plan resources, communication, and risk
management.

3. Execution:

- Assign tasks to team members.

- Implement project plans.

- Manage teams and communication.

- Ensure quality assurance processes are followed.

4. Monitoring and Controlling:

- Track project progress.

- Perform quality control.

- Manage changes to scope, schedule, and costs.

- Report performance to stakeholders.

5. Closure:

- Finalize all project activities.

- Obtain formal acceptance of deliverables.

- Release project resources.

- Document lessons learned and archive project
documents.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Waterfall is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one. Alternatively, Agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look before they start.
Differences: Approach: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next phase.
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
is the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.The process of requirements engineering involves gathering information,analyzing and documenting and then the requirements needed to be verified and managed throughout the project to handle any chenges or updates that may rise.It is important because it sets the stage for entire project.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
This refers to breaking down a software system into separate modules that can be developed and maintained independently.It improve maintaibility and scalability of software systems by allowing developers to focus on individual modules without affecting entire system and enables the system to grow by adding new modules impacting entire system.
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
 Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
 Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
 Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
 Properly planned and executed testing is invaluable for reducing project risk, providing confidence in the software quality, meeting compliance needs, ensuring satisfied users, enabling continuous improvement, and reducing overall costs.
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter that why they are important.Examples of version control systems are git and helix core 
Features of version control systems;
Reliable: keep versions around for as long as we need them; allow backups.
Multiple files: track versions of a project, not single files.
Meaningful versions: what were the changes, why where they made?
Revert: restore old versions, in whole or in part.
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
roles of software project manager are setting and managing client expectations, developing a detailed project plan, defining the scope of the project, understanding project risks and assigning team members to specific tasks.Challenges are Misalignment between goals and business objectives,Communication,Lack of accountability,Resource allocation.The key responsibilities are discussing new projects and proposals with clients,colleagues and other stakeholders,planning software projects, determining scope and setting deadlines,assembling project teams and allocating roles.
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
software maintanence is the  process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.Maintenance is important because the maintenance phase in the software development process is where the software is monitored to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed. After the software is released into production, updates or upgrades will need to be made.
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues that software engineers might face are,addictive design,corporate ownership of personal data,algorithmic bias,weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection and overemphasis on features.
By considering ethical implications throughout the development process and staying informed about emerging ethical challenges, professionals can ensure that their products contribute positively to society while upholding ethical standards it can help to adhere to ethical standards.
Submission Guidelines:

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
